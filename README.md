# Jace's Library

## Description

Jace's Library was the exclamation point at the end of our 16 week long coding bootcamp. We were challenged to design a single-page application that featured at least 4 models using MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM for the database; used React for the front end; and GraphQL with a Node.js and Express.js server.

Additionally, we were tasked with using queries and mutations for retrieving, adding, updating and deleting data all while being mindful to include JWT authentication.

As a bonus, we also included a payment platform called KO-FI even though it was optional, but we wanted to put what we learned into practice!

## Features
- Responsive UI made with Material UI
- Ability to add and save cards to a collection that is tied to the user's account
- A login/sign up function that allows users to create the aforementioned account
- Usage of the scryfall data to render cards, provide descriptions, mana costs and other data.
